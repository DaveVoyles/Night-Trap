I spent about 45 minutes bringing this over to the browser today. The code is all done in JavaScript, and I'm using the open source [Video.JS player](http://www.videojs.com/) to display the video on most devices (mobile included). 

The video is streaming from [Azure Media Services](http://www.davevoyles.com/?s=azure+media+services). I'd suggest giving it a minute to load before advancing the screen. 

There's obviously still a lot of work to go. Special thanks to Phil Cobley in the [Night Trap](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NightTrap/) Facebook group for chopping up the footage!

----------
### To do:

- Add interactivity to catch augers
- Create a UI
- Chop up the clips to create branching paths (ex: caught / missed an aug)
- Add the color coordinated password system
- Pause Screen
- Get raw footage, to prevent that *click* noise from going off every time you miss an auger
- Get multiple video feeds to buffer as soon as the page loads. Allows for quicker camera changes.
