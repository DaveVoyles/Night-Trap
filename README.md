I spent about 45 minutes bringing this over to the browser today. The code is all done in JavaScript, and I'm using the open source [Video.JS player](http://www.videojs.com/) to display the video on most devices (mobile included). 

The video is streaming from [Azure Media Services](http://www.davevoyles.com/?s=azure+media+services). I'd suggest giving it a minute to load before advancing the screen. 

Special thanks to Phil Cobley in the [Night Trap](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NightTrap/) Facebook group for his SCAT tool which allowed me to rip the video footage from the Sega CD disc.
